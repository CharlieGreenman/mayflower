# Design Principles

Anytime you make a decision about Mass.gov - about what information should go on a page, how to write something, whether to use an image or not, etc. - run it past these 4 pillars. If your decision satisfies all of them, it’s a good decision.

### Brand Pillars

A brand is a conceptual thing, but it shares some similarities with real-world objects like buildings. They both rely upon a strong framework to hold their shape. In the same way that buildings are held up by load-bearing pillars, brands are held up by brand pillars.

So what defines the Mass.gov brand?

Almost 7 million people live in Massachusetts, in large cities and small towns, on the coast and in the mountains. And this website is for all of them - as well as all the people who come to Massachusetts from all over the world to vacation, learn at our schools, or catch a Sox game.

Using brand pillars helps us identify a few central, critical principles which are easy to remember and refer to, and which truly define the brand in all scenarios. This brand doesn’t need to encompass all of Massachusetts - because while it’s true that Mass.gov represents all of Massachusetts, the Mass.gov brand needs to be more specifically focused on helping constituents get things done on this website.

These are the 4 brand pillars that guide us towards achieving Mass.gov’s goal of being the Commonwealth’s customer service desk.
